</ol>
<h3 id="Dining-philosophers-problem"><a href="#Dining-philosophers-problem" class="headerlink" title="Dining philosophers problem"></a>Dining philosophers problem</h3><p>is an example problem used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues.<br>Fiving slient philosophers sit at a round table. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.<br>Each philosopher must alternately think and eat.<br>A philosopher can eat only when he have both left and ritht forks. No philosopher knows when others may want to eat or think.<br>The challenge is to avoid deadlock, a system state in which no progress is possible.<br>In this problem, the deadlock happens when each philosopher pick up the left fork, and is waiting for the right fork to be available. Then the philosophers will wait for each other to release a fork.<br>timing and retry. There may be a rule that the philosopher put down a fork after waiting 10 minutes for another fork and wait a 5 minutes before making a next attempt. This scheme eliminates the possibility of deadlock but still suffers from livelock when five philosophers pick up the left fork at the same time.</p>
<h5 id="Solutions"><a href="#Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Solutions"></a>Solutions</h5><ol>
<li>Resource hierarchy solution<br>Here, the resources (forks) will be numbered 1 through 5 and each unit of work (philosopher) will always pick up the lower-numbered fork first, and then the higher-numbered fork, from among the two forks they plan to use. The order in which each philosopher puts down the forks does not matter. In this case, if four of the five philosophers simultaneously pick up their lower-numbered fork, only the highest-numbered fork will remain on the table, so the fifth philosopher will not be able to pick up any fork. Moreover, only one philosopher will have access to that highest-numbered fork, so they will be able to eat using two forks.</li>
<li>Arbitrator solution<br>Another approach is to guarantee that a philosopher can only pick up both forks or none by introducing an arbitrator, e.g., a waiter. In order to pick up the forks, a philosopher must ask permission of the waiter. The waiter gives permission to only one philosopher at a time until the philosopher has picked up both of their forks. Putting down a fork is always allowed. The waiter can be implemented as a mutex. In addition to introducing a new central entity (the waiter), this approach can result in reduced parallelism: if a philosopher is eating and one of their neighbors is requesting the forks, all other philosophers must wait until this request has been fulfilled even if forks for them are still available.</li>

<h3 id="priority-queue-vs-heap"><a href="#priority-queue-vs-heap" class="headerlink" title="priority queue vs heap"></a>priority queue vs heap</h3><p>A priority queue is an abstract data type where each element has a “priority” associated with it.<br>In priority queue, an element with high priority dequeue before the element with low priority.<br>While priority queue is often implemented with heap, they are conceptually different from heap.<br>A priority queue is abstract concept like “a map”, a map can be implemented with RB-Tree or hash table, a priority can be implemented with a heap or something else.</p>
<h3 id="heap-sort"><a href="#heap-sort" class="headerlink" title="heap sort"></a>heap sort</h3><p>is an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted region and an unsorted region. It iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that into the sorted region.<br>Although somewhat slower than a well-implemented quick sort, it has the advantage of a more favourable worst-case O<br>(nlogn) runtime. And it is an inplace but not a stable algorithm.<br>steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>call heapify(), build a heap in O(n) operations. Floyd down to top siftdown.</li>
<li>swap the first element of the input vector with the final element. Now the final element is in its correct position. Decrease the considered range of the vector by one.</li>
<li>call siftdown() to restore the unsorted region into a heap.</li>
<li>Go to step 2, unless the considered range of the vector has only one element.</li>

<ul>
<li>Reliable - Strictly only at transport layer, TCP manages message <strong>acknowledgement, retransmission, timeout</strong>. This reliability does not cover application layer, at which a separate acknowledgement flow control is still necessary.</li>
<li>ordered - if two messages are sent over a connection in sequence, the first message will reach the receiving application first. When data segments arrive in wrong order, TCP buffers delay the out-of-order segments utill all data segments can be properly re-ordered and delivered to application.</li>
<li>heavyweight - TCP requires handshaking (3 packets) to set up connection, before data be sent. TCP handles reliability and <strong>congestion control</strong>.</li>
<li>streaming - data is read as a byte stream, no distinguishing indications are transmitted to signal message boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UDP</strong> (user datagram protocol) is a simpler message-based connectionless protocol. Communication is achieved by transmitting information in one direction from source to destination without verifying the readiness or the state of receiver.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unreliable - When a UDP message is sent, it can be not known if it will reach its destination; it could be lost along the way. there is no concept of acknowledgement, retransmission, timeout.</li>
<li>not ordered - if two messages are sent to same recipient, the order in which they arrive can’t be predicted.</li>
<li>ligthweight - it’s a small transport layer designed on top of IP.</li>
<li>datagrams - packets have definite boundaries, which means that a read recipient at the receiver socket will yield an entire message as it was sent originally.</li>
<li>no congestion control</li>
<li>broadcast - being connectionless, UDP can broadcast. Sent packets are accessible by all devices on the subnet.</li>

<h3 id="Connection-establishment-of-TCP"><a href="#Connection-establishment-of-TCP" class="headerlink" title="Connection establishment of TCP"></a>Connection establishment of TCP</h3><p>three-way handshake<br>Before a client attempts to connect with a server, the server must first bind to and listen to a port to open it up for connections: this is called ‘passive open’. Once the passive open is established, a client may initiate an ‘active open’.<br>To establish a connection, the three-way shake occurs:</p>
<ol>
<li>SYN: The client sends a SYN to server. The sequence number is set to a random value A;</li>
<li>SYN-ACK: In response, the server replies with a SYN-ACK. The acknowledgement number is set to A+1; The sequence number is set to another random value B.</li>
<li>ACK: Finally, the client sends a ACK to server. The acknowledgement number is set to B+1; the sequence number is set to A+1.</li>
</ol>

<li>processes have independent/separate address space, while threads in a process share their address space.</li>
<li>context switching between threads is much faster than context switching between processes.</li>
<li>processes interact only throuth system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms.</li>

<li>variables created on heap must be destroyed manually.</li>
<li>allocation on stack is faster than heap</li>
